                As I started Blue Night, I contemplated on how to incorporate myself well into the program... 
                As expected, the conclusion is communicating with listeners and music! 
                That's why I have prepared a project where I personally write a song pertaining to a listener's story and let you hear it. 
                The name of the corner is "Blue Night Lyrics, That Man's Composition". It won't be aired every week, 
                but it will be aired once every few months as a special corner, so please send in a lot of stories, 
                I'm accepting stories through the homepage.

                All the songs from the release were previously revealed on Jonghyun's radio show Blue Night between July 2014 and July 2015 in demo form, 
                and rearranged versions were included on the album. "End of a Day" was the lead single of the album, 
                which was released on September 17, 2015. The music video stars Ryohei Otani.
